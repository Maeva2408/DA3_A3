####SAMPLE SELECTION

# I need data from November on weekday

# data already good!

# Introduction

This analysis aimed at predicting the price of hotels in Vienna in order to find the best deals.The data used was gathered in a csv files : The hotels-vienna.csv.The main variables that I used were: the price in euro (y). My sample is the price of the hotels in Vienna in the weekday of November 2017.

# Data

# Label Engeneering

# I want to define my y variable
# It is a prediction of price to find the best deals In Vienna
# Price distribution

summary_table <- summary(data$price)
pander(summary_table)

data %>% 
  keep(is.numeric) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= price))+

# I Will filter out the hotels price more than 400 euro

data <- filter( data ,price <= 400)

data %>% 
  keep(is.numeric) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= price))+
  geom_histogram(fill= "orangered4", col= "salmon")+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_fill_wsj()+
  labs(x = "Price in euro",y = "count of hotels")


# better distribution, I will not transform my y variable, it will be easier for my residuals without transform it again
yvar <- "price"


```

## Label engineering

My predicted variable is the price of hotel in Euro. I kept only the price under 400 euro

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='asis', warning= FALSE, message=FALSE}
pander(summary_table)
data %>% 
  keep(is.numeric) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= price))+
  geom_histogram(fill= "orangered4", col= "salmon")+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_fill_wsj()+
  labs(x = "Price in euro",y = "count of hotels")

```


The minimun price for a night is 27 euro and the maximum 384 euro. The mean is 122.9 euro.
I observed that the distribution of the price is skewed with a right tail and some extreme values.
I did not transform my y variable to simplify my interpretation of the residuals

location <- c("f_neighbourhood", "distance", "distance_alter")

rating <- c("stars", "rating","rating_count", "ratingta",

value <- c("scarce_room", "offer", "offer_cat")

# I will add some interactions based on common knwoledge

interactions <- c("distance*stars", "distance_alter*stars", "distance*rating", "distance_alter*rating")

## group the variable into categories
# I will group them by adding more and more categories, and I choose the first one as benchmark, where I put only
# stars


```

I decided to categorize my X variable in 4 categories :

**Location**

* the neigbhourhood : I factorized all the different neigbhourhood, and if a neigbhourhood appears less than 5 times in the data set, it is categorized as small_neigbhourhood

* Distance : It is the distance from the city center, I only kept hotel that were maximum 5km away of the city center

* distnace_alter : It is the distance from the Donauturm.

**RatingÂ¨**

* stars : This variable show the total of stars of the hotels

* rating : It's the user rating average, they were some missing values that I remplace by 0, I did not flag them because, no other hotels had 0 as rating and I did not want to add variable if it was not needed

* rating_count : It is the number of user ratings, they were some missing values that I remplace by 0, I did not flag them because, no other hotels had 0 rating and I did not want to add variable if it was not needed

* ratingta : It's the user rating average from the website Tripadvisor, they were some missing values that I remplace by 0, I did not flag them because, no other hotels had 0 as rating and I did not want to add variable if it was not needed

* ratingta_count : It is the number of user ratings in the tripadvisor website, they were some missing values that I remplace by 0, I did not flag them because, no other hotels had 0 rating and I did not want to add variable if it was not needed

**Value**

* scarce_room : This variable was flagged, if room was noted as scarce

* offer : This variable was flagged, if there was an offer available 

* offer_cat ; The offers for the roooms were categorized


**Interactions**

I choose my interactions with common knowledge :

* distance with stars

* distance_alter with stars

* distance with rating

* distance_alter with rating

I decided to keep only hotels as a type of accomodation and only thoses that were in the actual city Vienna
My sample is composed by 246 observations.

# Models

```{r, include=F, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# I will choose my models them by adding more and more categories


X1 <- c(location)
X2 <- c(location,rating)
X3 <- c(location,rating, value)
X4 <- c(location,rating, value, interactions)


# Models

model1 <- paste0(" ~ ",paste(X1,collapse = " + "))
model2 <- paste0(" ~ ",paste(X2,collapse = " + "))
model3 <- paste0(" ~ ",paste(X3,collapse = " + "))
model4 <- paste0(" ~ ",paste(X4,collapse = " + "))


```

I chose my models by gradually add more categories at each model.

* **X1** : Location

* **X2** : Location, _rating_

* **X3** : Location, rating, _value_

* **X4** : Location, rating, value, _interactions_

## Hold out set and cross validation

```

I will not do an holdhout set because I only have 246 observations and my goal is not to predict price for a live data
but find the best deals in my actual data. However, I will do a 5-fold cross-validation to estimate models.
